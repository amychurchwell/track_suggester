A quiz to help prospective students decide what programming language they should learn. Each answer is assigned a value which is then totaled into an answer variable. The answer is then put into formulas that dictate the number range. Different number ranges are assigned to three different languages:
  1. C#
  2. RUBY
  3. PHP

## Known Bugs

All bugs correlate to the number ranges given to each possible result.
Currently testing another method of determining frequency of certain answers.
*The possibility of a tie has not been addressed.*
_There is overlap in results due to the limited nature of the number ranges:
* C# and Ruby can both have winning values of 9
* Ruby and PHP can both have winning values of 11 and 12._
