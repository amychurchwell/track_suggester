## Description

A quiz to help prospective students decide what programming language they should learn. Each answer is assigned a value which is then totaled into an answer variable. The answer is then put into formulas that dictate the number range. Different number ranges are assigned to three different languages:
  1. C#
  2. RUBY
  3. PHP

_Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?_

## Known Bugs

An issue that I have not yet resolved is in regards to the number ranges that are assigned to each result.
*The possibility of a tie has not been addressed.*
